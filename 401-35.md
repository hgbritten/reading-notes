> A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Common terms
- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

> An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

> A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge. A tree is a form of this kind of graph
- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic
- An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
- A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
