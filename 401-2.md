## Read & Write Files in Python

### What is a file?
- Three main parts
  - Header: metadata about the contents of the file (name, size, type and so on)
  - Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
  - End of file(EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

> What this data represents depends on the format specification used, which is typically represented by an extension. For example, a file that has an extension of .gif most likely conforms to the Graphics Interchange Format specification. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of file extensions out there. For this tutorial, you’ll only deal with .txt or .csv file extensions.

### File paths
- Folder path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
- File name: the actual name of the file
- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period used to indicate the file type such as .txt or .md

#### Opening a file
```
file = open('file_im_opening.txt')
```

#### Closing a file
```
file.close()
```

### Line endings
- Line endings are used to specify a new line or the end of a line
- Carriage Return or \r and Line Feed \n are end of line characters according to the ASA

### Ensuring files are closed
- try and finally code block

## Always make sure that an open file is properly closed

### Using with 
- only runs the code until the code below is no longer indented

### r w rb or wb
- r: open for reading (default)
- w: open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
- rb or wb: open in binary mode

### Buffered Binary Files Types
> A buffered binary file type is used for reading and writing binary files. Here are some examples of how these files are opened:

```
open('abc.txt', 'rb')

open('abc.txt', 'wb')

```

### Iterating Over Each Line in the File

```
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     line = reader.readline()
>>>     while line != '':  # The EOF char is an empty string
>>>         print(line, end='')
>>>         line = reader.readline()
Pug
Jack Russell Terrier
English Springer Spaniel
German Shepherd
Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Golden Retriever
West Highland White Terrier
Boxer
Border Terrier
```

- readlines() vs readline()
  - readlines returns a list where each element in the list reps a line in the file


### Write lines
- write(string): writes the string to the file
- writelines(seq): writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. It's up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s)

```
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
    # Note: readlines doesn't trim the line endings
    dog_breeds = reader.readlines()

with open('dog_breeds_reversed.txt', 'w') as writer:
    # Alternatively you could use
    # writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))

    # Write the dog breeds to the file in reversed order
    for breed in reversed(dog_breeds):
        writer.write(breed)

```


### Bytes
> Sometimes, you may need to work with files using byte strings. This is done by adding the 'b' character to the mode argument. All of the same methods for the file object apply. However, each of the methods expect and return a bytes object instead:

```
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb') as reader:
>>>     print(reader.readline())
b'Pug\n'

```

## dos2unix
> This tool is broken up into three major sections. The first is str2unix(), which converts a string from \r\n line endings to \n. The second is dos2unix(), which converts a string that contains \r\n characters into \n. dos2unix() calls str2unix() internally. Finally, there’s the `__main__` block, which is called only when the file is executed as a script. Think of it as the main function found in other programming languages.

```

line endings with Unix like line endings.

### Don't reinvent the snake
> There are common situations that you may encounter while working with files. Most of these cases can be handled using other modules. Two common file types you may need to work with are .csv and .json. Real Python has already put together some great articles on how to handle these:

[CSV](https://realpython.com/python-csv/)
[JSON](https://realpython.com/python-json/)
