## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python
- TDD = Test-Driven Development
- Write tests first and code with them in mind

### Things to know
- Don't be afraid of testing and refactoring! It is a necessary part to building good code
- Ah yes an example!

```

def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(â€˜Anaâ€™)
    assert expected_gender == â€˜femaleâ€™

```

- Test names need to follow the same naming convention as the file they are testing.
- snake_shack.py becomes test_snake_shack.py

### The three A's
- Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
- Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
- Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
- Preferable to use the lib pytest


### The Cycle
- ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isnâ€™t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
- âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
- ðŸ”µ Refactor the code â€” the first version doesnâ€™t need to be the beautiful one (donâ€™t be shy)

### Things to remember
- The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
- Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace
- Beginning may be hard â€” and thatâ€™s fine. You just need to practice!


## Recursion
- What is it?
> The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

### Examples of mathematical recursion

```
Normal programmer approach:
approach(1) â€“ Simply adding one by one

f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +â€¦â€¦..+ n

Mathematical approach:
approach(2) â€“ Recursive adding 

f(n) = 1                  n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1
```

### What is the base condition in recursion?
> In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.
