## What is a linked list?
> A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
> There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

### Terms
> Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
> Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
> Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
> Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
> Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
> Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
> Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

### Traversal
- Can't use foreach or for loops in linked list.
- Use Next value instead
- Best way to do this is with a while() loop!
- Using this loop we can continually check Next to see if it is null or where we go next.

```

ALGORITHM Includes (value)
// INPUT <-- integer value
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

  Current <-- Head

  WHILE Current is not NULL
    IF Current.Value is equal to value
      return TRUE

    Current <-- Current.Next

  return FALSE

```

- In this we are setting current at the head and then checking it for next in our while loop.
- Also that means if current doesn't have what we want we know we can move on
- If we never find what we want we return the boolean of false

### Big O
- For the above algorithm the Big O is O(n) because you don't know how many times you will need to search the next list item


### AddBefore

```

ALGORITHM AddBefore(newValue, valueToAddBefore)
// INPUT <-- New value, Value to add before
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

  Current <-- Head

  IF Current is equal to NULL
    return FALSE

  WHILE Current.Next is not equal to NULL
    IF Current.Next.Value is equal to valueToAddBefore
      newNode <-- NEW Node
      newNode.Value <-- newValue
      newNode.Next <-- Current.Next
      Current.Next <-- newNode
      return TRUE

    Current <-- Current.Next;

  return FALSE

```

## What is a linked list anyway? 
- Linear data structures
  - This means there is a sequence or order to how they are constructed and traversed.
  - It is like a game of *hopscotch!*
  - You can only go to the next tile by steping on the tile before it.

- Linked lists are nice because they can allocate memory differently and more efficiently.
