## Encryption, decryption, and cracking
- The earliest example of data encryption was Julius Caesar. He would send his messages with a shift of 3. Which means he would take every letter in the roman alphabet over one direction 3 spaces. This way his enemies wouldn't know what they received.
- There are 3 examples of ways to break ciphers: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.

### Frequency Analysis
- We tend to as english speakers use E the most. So it can usually be assumed if a letter shows up more than others it is the replacement for E.


### Known Plaintext
- If you already know what part of the message says you can usually find where that is and work backwards to find out the rest of the encrypted message.

### Brute Force
- Trying every one of the 25 possible shifts for each letter.
