## SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained 
>SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. 

> SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

> SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

## NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques
> NoSQL data modeling often starts from the application-specific queries as opposed to relational modeling
