1. The number of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. The idea that these at home computers were for men and boys was widely touted and most likely caused the drop.
2. Computer science classes were tailored to men and boys who had already been using computers from a young age and assumed people would already know the basics of computers.

1. My take aways from this reading are that not a single one of the companies has the even distribution of women to men based on the U.S. population. There are also an incredible amount of Asian people in these companies. Besides Asian people almost every other minority is under represented. White people are also somewhat underrepresented in a lot of the companies based on their portion of the U.S. population.

1. When research support diversity.
2. Diverse teams perform better than homogeneous ones because they are smarter and more creative. More voices with different ideas.
3. Because they can reach more of the market because they know their people.
