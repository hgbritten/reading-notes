# Node.js

<!-- https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/ -->

## Node and Node.js is interchangeable unlike Java and JavaScript.

## What is it? 
> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

<!-- https://nodejs.org/en/ -->

> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

## Node is built on google chromes V8 JavaScript Engine
- V8 is the engine that turns code into readable ones and zeros for your machine. 
>  Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

- running files with node can be as easy as typing node `<filename>` into your terminal.

### What is Node used for?
- Automating the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
> They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

> And if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm (or maybe Yarn). This isn’t because you need a Node back end to run these frameworks. You don’t. Rather, it’s because these frameworks (and many, many related packages) are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

> Node now plays a critical role in the technology stack of many high-profile companies.

> Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.

- lots of 1/0s but it does well to keep node's overhead small. 

> Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration

### Benefits?
> Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.


## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

- Basically pair programming is kind of the end all be all. People do their best coding work when paired up with someone else. Not only does it help you code better and faster it also is a learning and teaching experience for everyone involved.
