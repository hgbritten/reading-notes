## Tutorial: Basic Statistics in Python - Probabilty

### What is probability?
> "What is the chance of an event happening?"

- Python codee for flipping a coin
```

import random
def coin_trial():
heads = 0
for i in range(100):
    if random.random() <= 0.5:
        heads +=1
    return heads
def simulate(n):
    trials = []
    for i in range(n):
        trials.append(coin_trial())
    return(sum(trials)/n)
simulate(10)
>>> 5.4
simulate(100)
>>> 4.83
simulate(1000)
>>> 5.055
simulate(1000000)
>>> 4.999781

```

### The Three Sigma Rule
> Also known as the empirical rule or 68-95-7 rule.
- 68% of observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% fall between two and 97% fall between three

### Z-score

```
z = (xi - u)/o
z = z-score
xi = the data point
u = the mean
o = the standard deviation
```

## Dunder


### Magic Methods
- They are easy to recognize __  __()
- dunder stands for double under
- They should be treated as regular methods
- However. They let you emulate the behavior of built-in type methods for example the len("string") method
