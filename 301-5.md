# Thinking in React

<!-- https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html -->

## Break the UI Into a Component Hierarchy
- a basic structure:
  - FilterableProductTable
    - SearchBar
    - ProductTable
      - ProductCategoryRow
      - ProductRow 

- In React this could look like:

```

class ProductCategoryRow extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const category = this.props.category;
    return (
      <tr>
        <th colSpan="2">
          {category}
        </th>
      </tr>
    );
  }
}

class ProductRow extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const product = this.props.product;
    const name = product.stocked ?
      product.name :
      <span style={{color: 'red'}}>
        {product.name}
      </span>;

    return (
      <tr>
        <td>{name}</td>
        <td>{product.price}</td>
      </tr>
    );
  }
}

class ProductTable extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const rows = [];
    let lastCategory = null;
    
    this.props.products.forEach((product) => {
      if (product.category !== lastCategory) {
        rows.push(
          <ProductCategoryRow
            category={product.category}
            key={product.category} />
        );
      }
      rows.push(
        <ProductRow
          product={product}
          key={product.name} />
      );
      lastCategory = product.category;
    });

    return (
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Price</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>{rows}</tbody>
      </table>
    );
  }
}

class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." />
        <p>
          <input type="checkbox" />
          {' '}
          Only show products in stock
        </p>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

class FilterableProductTable extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <SearchBar />
        <ProductTable products={this.props.products} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}


const PRODUCTS = [
  {category: 'Sporting Goods', price: '$49.99', stocked: true, name: 'Football'},
  {category: 'Sporting Goods', price: '$9.99', stocked: true, name: 'Baseball'},
  {category: 'Sporting Goods', price: '$29.99', stocked: false, name: 'Basketball'},
  {category: 'Electronics', price: '$99.99', stocked: true, name: 'iPod Touch'},
  {category: 'Electronics', price: '$399.99', stocked: false, name: 'iPhone 5'},
  {category: 'Electronics', price: '$199.99', stocked: true, name: 'Nexus 7'}
];
 
ReactDOM.render(
  <FilterableProductTable products={PRODUCTS} />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);

```

- Many of these components were used in todays lab as well.
- The best way to start a project like this is to build it so it renders the UI, but has no interactivity. 
- The process of building it and thinking about the background behind everything use two very different parts of the brain (I really need to start doing this).
- Building the table from bottom up or top down is up to preference, although it is usually easier to go top down.

## Identify the Minimal Representation of UI State
- You want to use as little as possible to get the job done so you don't get bogged down by extra or repeated code and the less times you repeat yourself the better as always DRY(don't repeat yourself).

### Which one is state?
1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

- State is:
  - The search text the user entered
  - the value of the checkbox

- In the example above that is the class FilterableProductTable

>Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand, so follow these steps to figure it out:

### For each piece of state in your application:

- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
- Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
- If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

#### Strategy
- ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.
- The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.
- It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable


##### In Conclusion
> Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated.
