# Game of Greed 2

## Python Scope
<!-- https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/#the-global-statement -->

### Global
- Global variables do not work in specific functions in python unless they are given the global statement before them.
- The way below is how you do that.

```

>>> counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter():
...     global counter  # Declare counter as global
...     counter = counter + 1  # Successfully update the counter
...
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
1
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
2
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
3

```

- Once you have done the above all changes that you make to the counter global variable in the function will be reflected in the global variable itself.

> The use of global is considered bad practice in general. If you find yourself using global to fix problems like the one above, then stop and think if there is a better way to write your code.

- Refactor it:

```

>>> global_counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter(counter):
...     return counter + 1  # Rely on a local name
...
>>> global_counter = update_counter(global_counter)
>>> global_counter
1
>>> global_counter = update_counter(global_counter)
>>> global_counter
2
>>> global_counter = update_counter(global_counter)
>>> global_counter
3

```

### Non-local
- `nonlocal` works just like `global` with the key difference being that it does not apply to the global scope. It only applies to the function you are working in




## Big 0 Notation
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uqawfl0VHQ -->
- Try to always achieve a Big O(1) because this increases the speed of what you are doing.
- Logarithmic is the best possible outcome for time needed
