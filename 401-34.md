# Django Best Settings Practices
<!-- https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/ https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work -->

## Issues
- Different environments
- Sensitive data
- Shared settings between team members
- They are a python code.


## settings_local.py
- Set django settings with your own local file

## Best Practices
- keep settings in environment variables
- write default values for production configurations
- don't hardcode sensitive settings, and don't put them in VCS
- Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project
- Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.


# What is SSH?
- Secure Shell
> A remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.

## Different encryption techniques

### Symmetric Encrypt
> Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host. Effectively, any one possessing the key can decrypt the message being transferred.

### Asymmetrical Encrypt 
> Unlike symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.

### Hashing
> One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a unique value of a fixed length for each input that shows no clear trend which can exploited. This makes them practically impossible to reverse.
