# Introduction to React and Components

## What is React?
> A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small isolated pieces of codee called "components".

### React Component Subclasses:
> We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen


- Using 'extends' creates a react component class or type. A component takes in parameters which in this case are called properties(props) and 
- render method returns a React element.
- the createElement() function can be used to create your own element tag like div or li
- arrow functions help you keep things simple and streamlined and also work differently in the code.
- The onClick function was used for this tic tac toe example to register someones clicks and then afterwards we wanted its state to be changed with the setState function to an X
- xIsNext was used as a boolean to be flipped to choose from x's and o's. It was stuck in the handleClick funtion to flip the state every time a button is clicked.


### JSX
- Reacts main goal is separate concerns without separating technologies.
- JSX is the tool that helps you put mark up in the js file. 
- JSX is called in when a variable is wrapped in curly braces
- You can actually put any valid JS experssion inside the curly braces in JSX so things like user.firstName, 2 + 2.

<!-- https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html -->

- In the example below you can see we embed the result of calling a JS function into an <h1> element.

```
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```


- You can use quotes to specify string literals as attributes

```
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```

- And these two examples of code give the same outcome:

```

const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);

```

### More ways to render
<!-- https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html -->
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));

```

- Another great example of creating elements outside of the HTML file.
- Ooh! to make a ticking clock with JSX

```


function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);


```

- React only updates when necessary.

### Components and Props
<!-- https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html -->

> The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

```

- This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions. 
- You can also use an E6 class to define a component

```

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

``` 

- These two ways of defining components are equal in Reacts point of view.
