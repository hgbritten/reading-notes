# Choosing a Text Editor

> The wand chooses the wizard
## As long as you can do everything for your project with the text editor you have chosen it is the editor for you!

## The one you enjoy most!

> Another tool in the belt
## A text editor should allow you to write everything you need to in building a website

## Features?
- code completion - helps you speed through and avoid costly typos
- syntax highlighting - makes what you are typing easier to find and read
- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
- What are your must-have's?

> Nothing good in this life is free
## Although your computer comes with a text editor for free ninety nine. Chances are it's not your gal.

# **Always code in plain text**

## Since we already downloaded VS code I think that is what I will stick with, but I am also excited to try out Atom! It is one some of my close personal friends in the industry use.

### IDE is an all in one and that is off the table for now.

# Linux Tutorial - Command Lines
## There must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also
- cd
- ls
- (ect.)

## Output can either be seen, can't be seen, or were in error

## Once you see a prompt again you are ready to keep computing!

## echo $SHELL 

## Shortcuts automade and accessed using the arrow keys! NEETO!

# Linux 2 - NAv
## pwd (Print Working Directory)
- helps you find out where you are / current location

## ls (List)
- what else is here? 

## Square brackets and optional items

### Line 1 - We ran ls in it's most basic form. It listed the contents of our current directory.

### Line 4 - We ran ls with a single command line option ( -l ) which indicates we are going to do a long listing. A long listing has the following:
- First character indicates whether it is a normal file ( - ) or directory ( d )
- Next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory (we'll learn more about them in section 6)
- The next field is the number of blocks (don't worry too much about this).
- The next field is the owner of the file or directory (ryan in this case).
- The next field is the group the file or directory belongs to (users in this case)
- Following this is the file size.
- Next up is the file modification time.
- Finally we have the actual name of the file or directory

### Line 10 - We ran ls with a command line argument ( /etc ). When we do this it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.

### Line 13 - We ran ls with both a command line option and argument. As such it did a long listing of the directory /etc.

### Lines 12 and 18 just indicate that I have cut out some of the commands normal output for brevities sake. When you run the commands you will see a longer listing of files and directories. 

# Linux 3 - Everything is a file!

## keyboard? file. Monitor? file.

##  A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:
- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
- fun fact: Windows needs the extension to be correct to read it properly and linux just looks inside the file itself to see what it is.

## Linux is case sensitive so FILE1 and file1 are different, but in word they are the same.

## files with spaces will need ` and ' to keep them together

## if you need to nullify the meaning of a character use a backslash! I can't even type one out here!
