# CSS Style

## How does it work?
- Imagine there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way each individual box and what is inside it are presented
  
## How do you write rules?
- Rules are written in two parts: a selector and a declaration. eg: h1{font-family: Arial; color: yellow}


## How do those rules apply to HTML pages?
 - Last Rule: If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element the latter will take precedence.
- Specifiy: If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
- Important: You can add !Important after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element.


## How do you specify colors
- Colors are specified using RGB values such as: rgb(100.100.90) 
- There are also six digit hex codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color preceded by a pound or a hash # sign. Eg: #ee3e80
- There are also 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers like DarkCyan

## Common color terminology
- RGB values
- Hex codes
- Color names
- Hue
- Saturation
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Opacity
- HSL or HSLA being (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, and Alpha)


## Contrast and not going overboard
- Information can easily get lost if colors are too distracting.


## Background colors
- Background colors opperate much the same way as the rest of the colors
- If you do not specify a background color the background will be transparent.
