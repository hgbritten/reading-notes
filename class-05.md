# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Duckett HTML 

### Images
- Be relevant, convey info, convey mood, recognisable, color mesh.
- They can be stored on your sight or called from other websites.
- Height and width are really important when adding them in. Make sure it fits your page with all the other elements.
- Where to place? 
  - Before a paragraph
  - inside the start of a paragraph
  - in the middle of a p
- Three rules for creating images!
  - Save images in right format
  - Right size
  - Correct Resolution

### Color
- Bring a page to life
- RGB values, Hex codes, and color names can all be used to select a color.
- CSS3 is a new property that increases the range of colors by giving more information on the colors with hsl and hsla or hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha `(for transparency)`

### Text
#### Two group properties: Those that directly affect the font and its appearance, and thosse that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using.
- Typeface terms
  - serif - fancy!
  - san-serif - minus the fancy!
  - monospace - every letter is evenly spaced

- WSS
  - Weight Style and Stretch

- New align style! - Justify - great for journalism to take up the whole page.

## Blog Post
> Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in coulour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
