## The History of Version Control
  - Local VCS (orignally designed so programmers could work on a project with many states, but only on one hard disk)
  - Centralized VCS (SOMEONES HARD DISK BROKE AND WE LOST EVERYTHING!! Designed so that many programmers could work on the same project with that project being stored on a single server)
  - Distributed VCS (THE SERVER HARD DISK BROKE AND WE LOST EVERYTHING!!! Designed so that if a CVS goes down not all hope is lost. The DVC invention of the DVC has undoubtedly saved countless hours of work and streamlined working together as a team to finish projects)
  
### What is Git?
  - A DVCS that tracks all changes made and prevents the loss of data
  - Created my the great Linus Torvalds after a dispute over another popular DVCS BinKeeper
  - Git has many customizable features and is obviously easy for anyone interested in coding to start using considering we are using it on our first day of 102
  
 #### How does it work?
  - Once Git is installed on your computer and set up with your name and email it is time to ***clone*** your work! EXAMPLE: git clone https://github.com/test
