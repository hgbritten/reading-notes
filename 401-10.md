# Stacks and Queues

## What is a stack?
> A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous

### Common Terms
1. Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2. Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
3. Top - This is the top of the stack.
4. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
5. IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### Remember your dog FILO
- First In Last Out
  - The first item in a stack is always the last item out

- Last In First Out
  - The last item in a stack is always the first one out
  - Think a stack of waffles(pancakes are not for me)

### Push O(1)
- Pushing a Node on a stack is only an O of one because you are only changing one attribution on that list

#### Pseudocode

```
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```

### Pop O(1)
- Pop is also like push when dealing with nodes. You just reassign one thing

#### Temporary variables are important for linked lists and not losing nodes

#### Pseudocode

```
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

### Peek O(1)
- This is also an O of 1 because you are only looking at the top of a stack


#### Pseudocode

```

ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

### IsEmpty O(1)
- Just checks if there is anything in the LL and returns typically a boolean


#### Pseudocode

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL


```



## What is a Queue?
- Common terms

1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

- FILO and LILO are also followed for queues

### If stack is a tower queue is a school building. Instead of traversing floors you are checking rooms in a hallway

#### Much of the same concepts apply here
- You can think about stacks and queues the same way
