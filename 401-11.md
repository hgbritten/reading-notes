# Data Analysis


## JupyterLab
> JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

- JupyterLab lets us work with documents such as Jupyter notebooks.
> You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing

- Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.
- Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.
- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.
- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.

## Numpy
> NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. 

- Numpy and it's origins are so old that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python uses Numpy in some way

### .csv

```
"fixed acidity";"volatile acidity";"citric acid";"residual sugar";"chlorides";"free sulfur dioxide";"total sulfur dioxide";"density";"pH";"sulphates";"alcohol";"quality"
7.4;0.7;0;1.9;0.076;11;34;0.9978;3.51;0.56;9.4;5
7.8;0.88;0;2.6;0.098;25;67;0.9968;3.2;0.68;9.8;5
```

- The above is called ssv data or (semicolon separated values)

### Numpy uses multidimensional arrays

```
import csv
with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)

```
