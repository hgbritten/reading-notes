## What is functional programming?
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### What makes a function pure?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
  - Any function taht relies on random number generation cannot be pure because of this

### Immutability
> When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

- In OOP in Ruby

```

class UrlSlugify
  attr_reader :text
  
  def initialize(text)
    @text = text
  end

  def slugify!
    text.downcase!
    text.strip!
    text.gsub!(' ', '-')
  end
end

UrlSlugify.new(' I will be a url slug   ').slugify! # "i-will-be-a-url-slug"

```

- This process takes it all to lower case then removes useless white spaces and finally replace remaining white spaces with hyphens

> pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

### Filter 
> Given a collection, we want to filter by an attribute. The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection. Basically, if the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result collection. Otherwise, it will not.

### Map
> The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

### Reduce
> The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.

# Readability
> There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives.

> There are no absolutes when it comes to clean code — there's always an edge case!
