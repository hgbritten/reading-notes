# Reading 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript
<!--All notes come from John Duckett HTML and JS books-->

## HTML

### Intro
- The world wide web works in a set of steps.
- First you need to have an _Internet Service Provider_ or ***ISP***. You type in your desired domain such as google.com
- Then you connect to a Domain Name System or DNS server via the IP address of the given domain
- The return of that number allows your computer to browse the website requested.

### Structure
- HTML uses elements to describe the structure of the pages you are visiting with codes like head, header, main, body, p, h1, h2 and so on.
- Everything in HTML is included within tags that look like this - `<html></html>`
- The first html is an opening tag and the second is a closing tag because it includes a /
- Attributes can provide additional information about the contents of an element they appear in. They are made up of two parts a name and a value.

### Extra Markup
- If you need to make comments in your code that don't show up in you website in markdown and html you can use the `<!-- Comments go here -->` markers
- Escape Characters are characters that help you work around reserved characters for certain languages. HTML code uses the left and right angled brackets and they won't show up properly on the page unless you use their special codes like &lt; is actually `&lt;`

### HTML5 Layout
- Layout has changed in the update to HTML5.
- Everything is much easier to use and has its own name, look and feel.

### Process & Design
- Simple tools like site maps and wireframes can help you get an idea and feel for your website before you actually get to building it so you have a direction to go.
- Using design tools such as visual hierarchy, grouping and similarity, and design navigation can help keep your website attractive and engaging.
  

## JS

### Introduction 
- Quick refresher! CSS selectors indicate which elements the rule apply to. The declaration block contains rules taht indicate how elements should appear.

### ABC of Programming
- A: What is a script and how do I create one?
  - "To write a script you need to state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it."
- B: How do computers fit in with the world around them?
  - Computers create models of the world using data
  - Programmers can write code to say "When this event occurs, run taht code."
- C: How do I write script for a web page?
  - HTML is the content layer, CSS is the presentation layer, and JavaScript is the behavior layer
  - HTML is where the content of the page lives like the words and pictures that are shown
  - CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented like backgrounds, borders, colors and fonts.
  - JavaScript is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity like pictures enlarging when you hover over them.
