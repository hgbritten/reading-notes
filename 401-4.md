## Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage

### Fixtures
- Are you going to be writing more than one test? Of course you are.
- Use fixtures with parametrized tests

```
@pytest.fixture()
def simple_file():
  return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```

- A fixutre like this could be invoked like:

```
def test_reverse_lines(simple_file):
   assert reverse_lines(simple_file) == ['cba\n', 'fed\n',
 ↪'ihg\n', 'lkj\n']

```

- It looks like regular data since it wasn't invoked with parens like a function however it is actually a function under the hood. 
- this function uses yield instead of return.
> pytest understands that the post-yield code is for tearing down objects and connections. And yes, if your fixture has "module" scope, pytest will wait until all of the functions in the scope have finished executing before tearing it down.

### Coverage
- pytest-cov is something you can download to help make your tests *cover* more ground so to speak. However be careful because if you don't specify what they are there for they will test everything.

## Thinking Recursively in Python
> Problems (in life and also in computer science) can often seem big and scary. But if we keep chipping away at them, more often than not we can break them down into smaller chunks trivial enough to solve. This is the essence of thinking recursively...


### Dear Snakey Santa
> If the current problem represents a simple case, solve it. If not, divide it into subproblems and apply the same strategy to them.

- An Elf example


```

houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

# Each function call represents an elf doing his work 
def deliver_presents_recursively(houses):
    # Worker elf doing his work
    if len(houses) == 1:
        house = houses[0]
        print("Delivering presents to", house)

    # Manager elf doing his work
    else:
        mid = len(houses) // 2
        first_half = houses[:mid]
        second_half = houses[mid:]

        # Divides his work among two elves
        deliver_presents_recursively(first_half)
        deliver_presents_recursively(second_half)

```

### Recursion in Python
> A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions... This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

### Maintain your State!
> When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:
  - Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
  - Keep the state in global scope

- keeping state in global scope is achieved by keeping your variables outside your recursive function

### Recursive Data Structures
> A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself.

- A list is an example of a recursive data structure


## Classes and Objects 
> Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes.
> Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.
