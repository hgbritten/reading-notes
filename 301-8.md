# APIs

<!-- notes from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design  -->

## A well designed web API should aim to support
> Platform independence. Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally. This requires using standard protocols, and having a mechanism whereby the client and the web service can agree on the format of the data to exchange.

> Service evolution. The web API should be able to evolve and add functionality independently from client applications. As the API evolves, existing client applications should continue to function without modification. All functionality should be discoverable so that client applications can fully use it.

## REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia
- a great benefit of REST over HTTP is that it uses open standards and does not bind the implementation of the API of the client apps to any specific implementation.


## Main design principles of RESTful APIs
- REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
- A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be: `https://adventure-works.com/orders/1`
- Clients interact with a service by exchanging representations of resources. Many web APIs use JSON as the exchange format. For example, a GET request to the URI listed above might return this response body: `{"orderId":1,"orderValue":99.90,"productId":1,"quantity":1}`
- REST APIs use a uniform interface, which helps to decouple the client and service implementations. For REST APIs built on HTTP, the uniform interface includes using standard HTTP verbs to perform operations on resources. The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
- REST APIs are driven by hypermedia links that are contained in the representation. For example, the following shows a JSON representation of an order. It contains links to get or update the customer associated with the order. 

```
{
    "orderID":3,
    "productID":2,
    "quantity":4,
    "orderValue":16.60,
    "links": [
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"GET" },
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"PUT" }
    ]
}

```
