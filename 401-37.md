# ES6 React 1

## Legend
- Variable: x
- Object: obj
- Array: arr
- Function: func
- Parameter, method: a, b, c
- String: str

## Variables and constant feature comparison
- var, let and const

### Declarations

```

var x = 0

let x = 0

```

- All const variables are static and cannot be reassigned

### Arrow functions
> The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own this, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.

```

function func(a, b, c) {} // function declaration
var func = function (a, b, c) {} // function expression

```
