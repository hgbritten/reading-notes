## How the open authorization framework works
> OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.

### A simple example of OAuth is using one of your other websites credentials to login to another website.

### OAuth was designed with the user in mind to help transfer their data seemlessly to a new website.

## Authentication and Authorization

> AuthO uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) Protocol and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework to authenticate users and get their authorization to access protected resources. 

> Authenticaiton is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.
