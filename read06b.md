# Computer Architecture and Logic

## What makes a computer a computer?

### The four basic components
- Take input
- Store information
- Process it
- Output the results

### Fun facts
- They started off as wood machines
- They basically started off as a really slow calculator

## How do computers work?

### Ones and Zeroes - Outdated idea

### The bit is the smallest piece of information

### The binary number system
- The number 9 is 1001 in the binary number system
- Everything can be shown with binary numbers
- Sounds are vibrations and vibrations can be shown via a wave which can be assigned numbers and communicated via binary

## Circuits 
- A little over my head

## CPU and Memory

### Input travel pathway
- Press the b key on a key board 
- Converted to binary 
- CPU asks memory how to draw a b
- memory pulls that information and gives it to CPU
- CPU chooses the pixels to display on your screen.

### There are so many input and output methods. Some can be seen and felt and others can't

## Hardware and Software

### Software is all code and can't be seen in the physical world. 

### How does the software and hardware interact?
- The CPU has circuits which can do things like send and receive information or calculate math and logic.
- The memory is all binary!
- The CPU fetches the answers from the memory
- The CPU is basically a translator between us and binary in the memory
