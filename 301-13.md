# CRUD

1.  In my own words
- 100's = Informal status code. They can tell a user their request will fail before it has begun
- 200's = Success codes! 202 doesn't mean all the request was successful it just means it met all validation requirements
- 300's = Redirection codes. Tells the client that what they are looking for isn't there any more and they need to go to another location
- 400's = Client code errors. Invalid requests, timeouts, wrong UI, missing authentication. A client is sending and incorrect input and should confirm the input paras before retrying.
- 500's = Server code errors. Usually indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or servers that can't be reached. Best to retry your request incase it was a temporary issue.

2. 202 doesn't mean all the request was successful it just means it met all validation requirements

3. 308 is a permanent redirct status response. Given when a resource request has been definitively moved to the new URL.

4. 204 is a code that means there was no content given to the client.

5. 410 is the code for content that existed, but no longer does.

6. 403 Forbidden - client has no permission to access the resource.


# Build a REST API
1. We need to pull it out so we can switch out localhost with our actual route when necessary
2. Code that runs when the server gets a request but before it gets to your routes
3. It lets us accept json as a body rather than post element or get element
4. The colon in front means it is a parameter
5. Patch only updates based on what the user passes us. Put would update all the information even if they only gave us one thing.
6. You give it an object with default: inside
7. It means that there is an error on the server. It was entirely our server fault
8. 201 means successfully created an object. 200 just means success with no other implications.
