## JavaScript error messages && debugging

##### "unexpected feature" : "bug" hahah

### Types of error messages
#### Reference Errors
- Using a var that is not declared : not defined
- Always delcare your vars before you use them or they will get caught in the TDZ(Temporal Dead Zone)

#### Syntax Errors
- Don't try to use methods that can't be used that way

#### Range Errors
- Don't try to use the wrong length when talking to arrays. You can't have a negative value for an array length.

#### Type Errors
- String, Boolean, Object, Number: you can't use methods that are incompatible with these things
- This happens all the time to me

### Debugging
- console.log() is a simple way to check variables
- or typeof or instanceof
- you can also use breakpoints or debugger statements


### Call Stack
> The path your program has taken to reach the point where you set a breaking point or where you have an error

- Throwing a debugger; in your code can break down line by line what is happening with your code

- use names on your functions so the call stack is easier to navigate through.

### Handling Errors
- *try* to *catch* errors with the try and catch methods in your functions


### Tools to avoid runtime errors
- quokka
- eslint

## The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary
- Functions run in the order they are called in

```

function firstFunction(){
  console.log('hello from first');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
  console.log('hello from second');
}

secondFunction();

WILL PRINT IN THE CONSOLE

'hello from first'
'hello from second'

```

- This is how the stack operates everything in first => rest of everything in second
