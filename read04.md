# Structuring web pages with HTML

## Process and Design
> If it doesn't look good who wants to read it?

    - How do you attract and audience?
        - Companies or Individuals?
          - If they are individuals what is their age range? Where do they live? Do they speak the same language?
          - If the target is companies what size is the company? Who are the visitors there for? What is their position?
        - Why are they here?
            - What are their key motivations or specific goals?
        - What are they trying to achieve?
        - What information do they need? Do they even know who you are?
        - How often will they need your site?

    - How should you organize the information?
        - Site maps
        - Wireframes
        - 
    - What should the design layout be?
        - What should the content be?
        - How should the information be prioritized?
        - What information belongs on which group?
    - How do you make it look better?
        - How does the navigation look?
        - How does color contrast work in your website?

## Structure

    - Understanding Structure
        - What information is the most important?
        - What information belongs in the head? What about the body?
    - Learning about markup
        - A markup language will allow you to annotate text
    - Tags and elements
        - Did you close all your tags? Did you use the correct tag for what your content is?
        - Is this the correct language?

## HTML5 Layout

    - Streamlining HTML
      - Commands in HTML5 are much more intuitive now and require less work than previous iterations
      - Previously everything was under the div command
      - It makes everything in coding look that much cleaner

## Extra Markup

    - Specifying different versions of HTML
      - How do you indicate which version you are using? HTML4 used codes like center, font, and strike. All of these are now achieved with CSS instead. XHTML 1.0 had absolutely everything use a closing tag and all attributes had to be lowercase and placed in double quotes.
      - HTML5 is much more streamlined, but the thing you need to watch out for is making sure older computer users can use your website.
    - Identifying and grouping elements
      - How do you add comments to your code? I just did it but you can't see can you. The command is <!-- --> in HTML
      - Which element is necessary for the part of the page you are working on? Depends on how you want it formatted. Blocking is good for setting something apart whereas inline is great for something you want to keep in the same paragraph or sentence.
    - Comments, meta info and iframes
      - How do you add information about the web page using meta element? You place the meta element in the head and fill it with all kinds of information and key words so that people who need to find it can.
      - How do you embed a page within a page using iframes? The code <iframe> will let you cut a little hole in your page depending on how big you set it with the width and height adjusters. You then pick the page you want to display most commonly a google map and you are set to go.
      - How do you add characters like angled brackets and copyright symbols? Special codes for each of the escape characters exist.
      - < is &lt;
      - > is &gt;
      - & is &amp; or &#38;
      - " is &quot;
      - ` is &lsquo;
      - ' is &rsquo;
      - " or left quotes is &lqdquo; and right is &rdquo;
