# Structuring web pages with HTML

## Process and Design
> If it doesn't look good who wants to read it?

    - How do you attract and audience?
        - Companies or Individuals?
          - If they are individuals what is their age range? Where do they live? Do they speak the same language?
          - If the target is companies what size is the company? Who are the visitors there for? What is their position?
        - Why are they here?
            - What are their key motivations or specific goals?
        - What are they trying to achieve?
        - What information do they need? Do they even know who you are?
        - How often will they need your site?

    - How should you organize the information?
        - Site maps
        - Wireframes
        - 
    - What should the design layout be?

        - Is this the correct language?

## HTML5 Layout

    - Streamlining HTML
      - Commands in HTML5 are much more intuitive now and require less work than previous iterations
      - Previously everything was under the div command
      - It makes everything in coding look that much cleaner

## Extra Markup

    - Specifying different versions of HTML
      - How do you indicate which version you are using? HTML4 used codes like center, font, and strike. All of these are now achieved with CSS instead. XHTML 1.0 had absolutely everything use a closing tag and all attributes had to be lowercase and placed in double quotes.
      - HTML5 is much more streamlined, but the thing you need to watch out for is making sure older computer users can use your website.

      - Which element is necessary for the part of the page you are working on?
    - Comments, meta info and iframes
      - How do you add information about the web page using meta element?
      - How do you embed a page within a page using iframes?
      - How do you add characters like angled brackets and copyright symbols?
