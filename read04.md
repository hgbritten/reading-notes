          - If the target is companies what size is the company? Who are the visitors there for? What is their position?
        - Why are they here?
            - What are their key motivations or specific goals?
        - What are they trying to achieve?
        - What information do they need? Do they even know who you are?
        - How often will they need your site?

    - How should you organize the information?
        - Site maps
        - Wireframes

    - What should the design layout be?
        - What should the content be?

## Structure

    - Understanding Structure
        - What information is the most important?
        - What information belongs in the head? What about the body?
    - Learning about markup
        - A markup language will allow you to annotate text
    - Tags and elements
        - Did you close all your tags? Did you use the correct tag for what your content is?
        - Is this the correct language?
