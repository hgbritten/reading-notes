# Growth as a Lifestyle

## A growth mindset is something that is not easy to achieve let alone stay in. At least in the current day and age. To be in a growth mindset I first have to be in the moment. Then I have to deliberately not determine my actions or judgements based on previous bias. If I think I have nothing to learn from a situation I will learn nothing from it. So I must constantly be a student of life or I will miss it. We never know when the thing that will save us will present itself to us. We just have to be ready when it does. 

## How do I achieve living in the moment?
- I can stay **positive**. This starts with little victories like morning exercise and making the bed.
- I can continue to learn **_new_** skills or **_hone_** old ones. Being in _"the zone"_ is another way of being in the moment.
- I can reach out to others to get out of my own head and maybe help them with theirs


## In the words of Tim Lake:
> The truth is, I now don't travel back at all, not even for a day. I just try to live everyday as if I have deliberately come back to this one day, to enjoy it... As if it was the full, final day of my extraordinary, ordinary life.
