# Linear Regressions
- Info from https://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/ 
## Can we use x variable to predict y variable?

## Is there a relationship strong enough between x and y

## Scikit learn can perform linear regression in Python

```
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn
```

- Is what your import might look like

### Scikit learn implementation

```
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X = bos.drop('Price', axis = 1)

lm = LinearRegression()
lm
```
- Is what your code might look like for creating an X axis and values for your graph

lm.fit() - fits a linear model
lm.predict() - predict Y using linear model
lm.score() - returns a coefficient of the determination
> A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
